# CopyCat

>This is a memory game which is aimed at entertaining and frustrating any user who plays it. The game is solely based on working your brain to see if you can remember the pattern. The longer the pattern goes on, the harder it gets. If you think you have what it takes, go ahead and give it a shot!

## UX

The purpose of this project is to create a static **(front-end only)** website aimed at entertaining users of all ages. I have built it using the languages I have learned so far - HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. The target audiences for this website are people of all ages who love a challenge, adults who like to keep their brain working efficiently and also children to help with their development skills. 

**In order for the target audience to achieve these things when visiting my website, I incorporated the following:**
- A nice and simple visual display to make the site easy on the eye for all visitors
- Easy functionality when playing the game, to allow younger children play at ease
- A "how to play" section to educate all users on how the game works
- A start button to give the user the choice on when they want to start the game
- A reset button to allow the user start the game over
- Strict mode - this makes the game more difficult as the pattern will not be repeated if the user guesses incorrectly
- A counter in the middle of the buttons which will show the user which round they are on

Underneath the heading there is a source and I chose master branch from the dropdown which allows you to host the website on GitHub Pages.
